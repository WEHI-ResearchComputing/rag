<p>We’re excited to announce that the Globus platform (accessible at <a href="http://app.globus.org">app.globus.org</a>) can now be used to share WEHI data with external collaborators! Globus is a data movement and transfer platform that has been in place at WEHI for several months, but we hope that this new feature will prove useful for many of your workloads.</p><p>Full information is available under the <a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Globus.aspx#guest-sharing" data-interception="off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>‘Guest Sharing’</strong></a> section of <a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Globus.aspx?xsdata=MDV8MDF8fGMxYzcyZGM3YjdkODQ3YTI1ZmE4MDhkYmViYWQ5Y2ZmfGFhN2M3MmUyYzVjZjRhNDBhMjJhYTU4NWMwNGNhMDdjfDB8MHw2MzgzNjI5MDMwOTg5MDg1ODR8VW5rbm93bnxWR1ZoYlhOVFpXTjFjbWwwZVZObGNuWnBZMlY4ZXlKV0lqb2lNQzR3TGpBd01EQWlMQ0pRSWpvaVYybHVNeklpTENKQlRpSTZJazkwYUdWeUlpd2lWMVFpT2pFeGZRPT18MXxMMk5vWVhSekx6RTVPamRsTVdSaE1UUXdNR0ppTkRRNU1ESTVOVFF4T1RjMU9EbGlNemhrTURBelFIUm9jbVZoWkM1Mk1pOXRaWE56WVdkbGN5OHhOekF3Tmprek5UQTVNRFE1fDcwNGViMmEzNzUwZTRhNTg1ZmE4MDhkYmViYWQ5Y2ZmfGY5Y2QzNmVjZDQxOTQyM2RiNmM3MDc1NmQ4NjA5ZGY4&amp;sdata=cE9Wb1g0Z0pXMHR2U3VROG0reDlnL3ArRVVleHBzLzFENGZReWFidnVWbz0%3D&amp;ovuser=aa7c72e2-c5cf-4a40-a22a-a585c04ca07c%2ciskander.j%40wehi.edu.au" data-interception="off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Globus guide</strong></a>, but the key points are:</p><ul><li>Only <strong><u>one-way sharing</u></strong> is available (from WEHI to externals, not external to WEHI)</li><li>Data must be copied or <strong><u>moved to your VAST Scratch area prior to sharing</u></strong> (as sharing is only available from VAST Scratch)</li><li>Domains of recipients must be <strong><u>pre-approved by our security team</u></strong> (though we’ll be adding to this list continually as researchers request new domains be added!)</li></ul><p>If you’re keen to get started, you’ll need to submit a one-off support ticket to gain access to sharing functionality (note that basic non-sharing functionality is already available to all users) - just email us at <a href="mailto:support@wehi.edu.au">support@wehi.edu.au</a>, and ask to be added to the Globus Sharing group. We’ll require a brief justification, approval from your lab head, and sign-off on our T&amp;Cs</p>
