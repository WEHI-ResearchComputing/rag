<h2><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Requesting Resources for Application Hosting</span></h2>
<p>In certain scenarios, research or business projects may necessitate application hosting, such as a web application or database server, which demands specific resources (compute, storage, or human). When the available Milton services cannot meet these requirements due to time constraints or other unique factors, researchers can follow the outlined procedure to request the necessary resources. However, <strong><span class="fontColorRedDark">not every application will be granted approval, and funding might be necessary for certain instances&nbsp;based on the request and the available resources</span></strong>. We currently don't have separate resources allocated for application hosting. Therefore, any approved resource requests will come from our existing Milton SLURM resource pool.<br></p><p>Applications may be hosted on physical or virtual machines that require computing, storage, networking, cooling, power, and other resources. Calculating the exact cost to WEHI for each server is challenging and will be estimated for the application's entire life, not just implementation and software licensing.</p><p>Applications necessitate:</p><ol><li><p><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary"><strong>Administration</strong></span>: A human resource is needed for user onboarding and offboarding, permission management, housekeeping and management processes, quality control, and more.</p></li><li><p><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary"><strong>Technical expertise</strong></span>: This includes patching and upgrading the application, monitoring its health and security, troubleshooting, and debugging. It's difficult to predict the time, effort, and budget needed for these tasks. When using open-source software or lacking a support contract, ITS will provide the best possible support but cannot guarantee success.</p></li><li><p><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary"><strong>Virtual machines</strong></span>: Technical expertise is needed for the initial implementation, annual upgrades, regular patching, and system health and security monitoring. Licensing costs may apply, depending on the chosen operating system (OS).</p></li><li><p><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary"><strong>Physical hardware</strong></span>: Computing, storage, and networking require at least annual upgrades, regular patching, and system health and security monitoring. In addition, hardware typically needs replacement every five years, requiring human and budget resources. Each application increases the complexity, volume, and time needed to complete such a refresh.</p></li><li><p>Disaster recovery planning and backups incur ongoing costs.</p></li><li><p><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary"><strong>Additional costs</strong></span> include power, cooling, server room fire suppression systems, and more.</p></li></ol><p>For support with national research clouds like <span class="fontColorBlue"><strong>ARDC Nectar Research Cloud</strong></span> or <strong><span class="fontColorBlue">Melbourne Research Cloud</span>, r</strong>esearchers are responsible for submitting applications to external entities, and RC will offer support in setting up solutions when possible. For public solutions, the WEHI security team and RC should be involved to ensure compliance with institutional policies and relevant external policies and procedures.</p><p>This procedure has been developed by <strong><span class="fontColorBlue">Research Computing</span></strong> and <span class="fontColorBlue"><strong>ITS </strong></span>and approved by <span class="fontColorBlue"><strong>ITGC</strong></span> in 2022.

The time-extension request is similar to the above initial request process, by filling out&nbsp;<strong><a title="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/rc2/ESTfC5C-Y_VEkZysE3u3NqkBj-OtgMVaTR9kPpOS0DT7Jw?e=lNiItO" data-interception="off" data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/rc2/ESTfC5C-Y_VEkZysE3u3NqkBj-OtgMVaTR9kPpOS0DT7Jw?e=lNiItO" href="/:w:/s/rc2/ESTfC5C-Y_VEkZysE3u3NqkBj-OtgMVaTR9kPpOS0DT7Jw?e=lNiItO">this form</a></strong>.</p><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Application Review</span></h3><p>Application review for decommissioning or resource reclamation may be triggered by the following&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Review time set at application approval, the life of the project or 3 years.&nbsp;</li><li>The application has not been accessed in 90 days.</li><li>The application owner indicates it is no longer required (e.g. the research or business requirement is complete).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>The application relies on an operating system that can no longer be supported, and then the application is deemed no longer supported and may be required to be decommissioned.&nbsp;</li><li>The application has become a security concern with no fix available.&nbsp;</li><li>Funding is no longer available for the resources and/or licensing.&nbsp;</li><li>Where over time, growth in resource requirements (technical and/or human) is no longer sustainable within existing funding arrangements&nbsp;</li></ol><p>The application owner will be consulted during the review process and have the option to request an&nbsp;extension. The extension is approved if the&nbsp;review process is favourable and there is the capacity to continue hosting. If&nbsp;RC and the application owner disagree over whether or not to decommission, the decision will be escalated to ITGC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Application Decommission</span></h3><p>When the decision to decommission has been approved, the application owner will be given <strong>30 days' notice</strong>, unless otherwise agreed.&nbsp;<strong>It is the responsibility of the requestor to archive any data in line with any applicable Research Data Governance and Management Policy or other relevant agreement or policy</strong>.&nbsp; RDGM team/RC/ITS will provide support as appropriate.&nbsp;A copy of the system will be taken and retained for <strong>90 days</strong> unless otherwise agreed.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Temporary Disablement&nbsp;</span></h3><p>ITS may, with minimal notice, remove access to the application until a fix or workaround is found. If the following occurs</p><ol><li>Security has been compromised or could be compromised due to a known vulnerability (e.g. to thwart a hacking attempt)&nbsp;</li><li>Stability has been compromised (i.e. the application is negatively impacting itself and/or other WEHI services, e.g. network traffic has increased effectively creating a DoS (Denial of Service) attack.</li></ol><p>ITS will need to be satisfied that the problem has been mitigated before bringing the resource back online.&nbsp; If&nbsp;downtime is substantial and impacts research, ITS may attempt where possible to sandbox the application for the requestor to access data in a timely manner. At the same time, the process of mitigation is ongoing.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Linking to Hosted Application&nbsp;</span></h3><p>When using the hosted application in a publication, the current recommended best practice is to link to the application through an external landing page whose &nbsp;URL is used in the paper. Thus, if/when hosting changes or the resource is reclaimed, the landing page can be&nbsp;updated, i.e. the external repository becomes the primary resource. You may also use a DOI minting service to create a persistent DOI for your application.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any application code, data, and documentation should also be made available in an external repository such as GitHub if applicable.</p><h4><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Why shouldnâ€™t I link directly to the WEHI-hosted application URL?&nbsp;</span></h4><ul><li><p>WEHI reserves the right to change the way applications are hosted, which may change the applicationâ€™s URL.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Individual applications will not be supported in perpetuity and are expected to be retired eventually â€“ see <strong><a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Requesting-Resources.aspx#application-review" data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Requesting-Resources.aspx#application-review" data-interception="on" title="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Requesting-Resources.aspx#application-review"><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Application Review</span></a></strong> above.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Data sharing on these servers must comply with all relevant licenses, agreements, and compliance requirements.&nbsp;Advice may be sought from the Research Governance, Risk and Compliance Office as/if required.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Examples of external landing pages include GitHub, figshare, Zenodoo, plus other solutions.&nbsp;</p>
