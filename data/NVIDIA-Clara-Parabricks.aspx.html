NVIDIA claims speedups of up to 80x compared to their serial CPU equivalents. Historically, the tool has required a paid license to use, but <a title="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/democratizing-and-accelerating-genome-sequencing-analysis-with-clara-parabricks-v4-0/" data-interception="on" data-cke-saved-href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/democratizing-and-accelerating-genome-sequencing-analysis-with-clara-parabricks-v4-0/" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/democratizing-and-accelerating-genome-sequencing-analysis-with-clara-parabricks-v4-0/">since GTC 2022</a>, they have made it free for academic purposes, meaning WEHI researchers can use it free-of-charge!</p><p>ITS have setup Clara Parabricks centrally via the <a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/modules.aspx" data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/modules.aspx" data-interception="on" title="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/modules.aspx">Environment Modules system</a> to make using the containers simpler.

However, the central installation we have at Milton is simplified, so the apptainer run command and options can be ommitted.
