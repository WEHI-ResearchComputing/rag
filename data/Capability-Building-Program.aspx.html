<h2><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">RCP Capability Building Program (CBP)&nbsp;</span></h2><p>The <span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">RCP Capability Building Program&nbsp;</span>is an initiative to&nbsp;encourage researchers across WEHI to engage with RCP&nbsp;in&nbsp;research projects. The RCP team has&nbsp;computational expertise in HPC and cloud&nbsp;and research software engineering. Visit our<a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/RCP-Projects.aspx" data-interception="off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> projects page</strong></a> to browse through our previous and current projects.&nbsp;</p><p>The aim of the program is to strengthen&nbsp;WEHI's technology-driven research and develop new strategic capabilities in computational research and data analytics. Through this program, researchers are encouraged to submit a research project idea as an Expression of Interest (EOI). The EOI process timeline is described below.</p><p>Submitted research project ideas should require&nbsp;a maximum of 17 hours per week for 3 months, and could&nbsp;be completed in this period. For longer projects, at least one milestone could be achieved in 3 months and the rest should be broken into 3 months milestones and submitted as&nbsp;new&nbsp;EOIs.&nbsp;A process and a committee, described below, will help&nbsp;prioritise&nbsp;these research project ideas&nbsp;based on specific selection criteria, described below.&nbsp;</p><p>As RCP has limited resources, we will not&nbsp;be able to commence on all project ideas&nbsp;that will be submitted. Some projects might be postponed to the next round based on the selection criteria described below.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, some projects may be resourced through the <a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Student.aspx" data-interception="off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSE Student Internship Program</a> (if appropriate) or RCP could help recruit and train new staff if they are externally funded.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Our Expectations</span></h3><p>The RCP member would&nbsp;be involved in regular project meetings and lab meetings if required.&nbsp;</p><p>If the research project results in publication, according to WEHI's&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.wehi.edu.au/Documents/Details/Index?id=193&amp;versionId=329" data-interception="off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Research Integrity Policy</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>the following should be considered.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Ensure that authors of research outputs&nbsp;have made a significant intellectual or scholarly contribution to the research and its output and that they agree to be listed as an author.</li><li>Acknowledge those who have contributed to the research.</li><li>Cite and acknowledge other relevant work appropriately and accurately.</li></ul><p>The planned project timeline will be followed to&nbsp;the best of both parties' capability. As they are research projects, flexibility is required to accommodate reasonable modifications within the timeframe of the project. If potential extensions are discovered, they should be well-documented and applied to the next round of EOIs.</p><p>Future maintenance and support will be done by researchers, if support is required, it will be subject&nbsp;to the availability of the RCP team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Researchers&nbsp;Expectations</span></h3><p>The&nbsp;allocated RCP team member will provide the agreed-on FTE to the project.&nbsp;Unexpected changes to the project deliverables or RCP workloads may cause a change to the project timeline. But best efforts will be exerted to avert that and plans will try to cater for reasonable changes to the project and work circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>As they are research projects, flexibility is required to accommodate reasonable modifications within the timeframe of the project.</p><p>By the end of the project, the project deliverable will be well-documented, and all documents and code will be shared on GitHub or any other platform, if appropriate or&nbsp;on a Milton storage if privacy is an issue.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Research Project Selection</span></h3><p>The Research Computing Leadership is the committee that prioritises the projects and takes the final decision on which projects are selected to go ahead right away. This committee is made of&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Tony Papenfuss</strong>, Computational Biology Theme leader</li><li><strong>Michael Carolan</strong>, Chief Information Officer (CIO)</li><li><strong>Miffy Edwards</strong>, ITS Research Systems Manager</li><li><strong>Julie Iskander</strong>, RCP Lead Research Computing Engineer</li><li><strong>Rowland Mosbergen</strong>, RCP Strategic Engagement and Planning Manager</li></ul><p>The <strong>selection criteria </strong>for the prioritisation of the EOIs are the following.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Does this project support a strategic priority at WEHI?&nbsp;</li><li>Does this idea/project develop or create new computational or data analytics capabilities? &nbsp;<ol><li>Allow scientists to make the most of large public datasets.</li><li>Ensure we can analyse big datasets generated in-house.</li><li>Enable multi-disciplinary research or futuristic research.</li><li>Supports research within&nbsp;multiple labs/groups in WEHI.</li></ol></li><li>Does this idea/project improve resource utilisation?  &nbsp;</li><li>Does this idea/project help make the most of IT resources available internally and externally? &nbsp;</li></ol>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemePrimary">Expression of Interest</span></h3><p>The assessment process is as follows.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Submit an Expression of interest (1-page max) described below</li><li>Consult with RCP on the details of the project through meetings and/or emails</li><li>Applications will be summarised by the RCP team and submitted to the RC Leadership</li><li>The RC Leadership team will assess the applications&nbsp;</li><li>If approved, a part-time (up to 0.5FTE) resource from RCP will be allocated to work on the project&nbsp; ​​​​​​</li></ol><p aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</p><p>The EOI assessment process occurs when we have at least three new submissions,&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">EOI Submission&nbsp;</span></h3><p>The EOIs can be submitted through <a href="https://forms.monday.com/forms/5a904ad597a26b1d59895f71305f4425?r=use1" data-interception="off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>this link</strong></a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;The following is required for the submission</p><figure class="table tableCenterAlign canvasRteResponsiveTable" style="width:1049px;" title="Table"><table class="ck-table-resized"><colgroup><col style="width:20%;"><col style="width:80%;"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>Required Fields&nbsp;</td><td>Example&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Title&nbsp;</td><td>Sharing genomics analyses for Leukemia&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Problem description&nbsp;</td><td>Share my genomics analyses with people outside WEHI in a simple and secure manner.
