<h2>Virtual machines (VMs)<br></h2><p>When you need access to significant on-demand or interactive resources, and other options such as the batch system are not suitable, you can provision an interactive virtual machine (VM). The VM will only be created when resources are available so in periods of high demand you may have to wait. If your requirement is urgent, contact <a href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" data-cke-saved-href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" target="_blank" data-interception="off" title="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au">Research Computing</a>.<br></p><p>In order to maximise the availability of resources there are limits on VMs that will be approved automatically:</p><ul><li>2 weeks duration, but extendable in 2-week increments through the portal</li><li>128GB of RAM</li><li>14 CPUs (hyperthreads)</li><li>1 concurrent VM per user.<br></li></ul><p>The purpose of these limits is to encourage users to think about their requirements and to ensure that resources are released when they are no longer needed. If you require a VM that exceeds these limits, please contact <a title="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" data-interception="off" data-cke-saved-href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au">Research Computing</a>.</p>
