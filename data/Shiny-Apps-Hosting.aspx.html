<h2><span class="fontColorBlue">Milton Shiny Apps Hosting</span></h2><p>Milton is now providing&nbsp;Shiny apps&nbsp;hosting.&nbsp; We have two solutions to choose from</p><ol><li><strong>Internal Shiny apps:</strong> An <strong>internal-only</strong> hosting, your app will be accessible to any WEHI user inside the WEHI network only.</li><li><strong>Public Shiny apps:</strong> A publicly available hosting, your app will be publicly available to anyone with a link.</li></ol><p>The <strong>Public Shiny apps</strong> service will host shiny apps that can be shared with external and internal collaborators and the scientific community. This service can be used to publish apps accompanying a paper publication, however,<span class="fontColorBlue"> it is the responsibility of the app developer to provide a public landing page</span> that will include the app address instead of a direct link to the app.</p><p>Users with ad-hoc needs for shiny servers to test or share data for a limited time should use <a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Open-OnDemand.aspx#shiny-app" data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Open-OnDemand.aspx#shiny-app" target="_blank" data-interception="off" title="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Open-OnDemand.aspx#shiny-app">Shiny App on OnDemand</a>.</p><p>Currently, there is <span class="fontColorRedDark"><strong><span class="fontColorRed">no app authentication</span> </strong></span>provided. Therefore, <strong>apps that use sensitive&nbsp;data that need access control <span class="fontColorRed">should not</span> be hosted using these servers.</strong>​​​​​​​</p><p>For details, please refer to the <a href="/:b:/s/rc2/EYgbpj3aRuhOgPwV7hoShJkB_2LzoLgvfOSz2XA1yMQDuw?e=GJuV1X" data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/rc2/EYgbpj3aRuhOgPwV7hoShJkB_2LzoLgvfOSz2XA1yMQDuw?e=GJuV1X" target="_blank" data-interception="off" title="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/rc2/EYgbpj3aRuhOgPwV7hoShJkB_2LzoLgvfOSz2XA1yMQDuw?e=GJuV1X">Shiny Server Hosting Policy and Operating Procedure</a>. It was developed by the Web-based Applications Working Group and had been endorsed by IT Governance Committee (ITGC) on the 16th February 2022.</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorBlue">Standard Operating Procedure Summary</span></h3>
<p>A key objective is to provide a procedure to manage Shiny apps through their lifecycle, including guidance on how to publish and eventually shutdown apps while avoiding deadlinks in publications and tying up resources for apps whose value may have diminished over time.</p>
<h4><span class="fontColorBlue">Resources Allocated</span></h4><p>Resources assigned to each server are shown below.</p><div class="canvasRteResponsiveTable"><div class="tableCenterAlign tableWrapper"><table border="1" style="width:352px;" class="simpleTableStyleTheme"><tbody><tr><td style="width:160px;"><p>RAM Memory&nbsp;</p></td><td style="width:138px;"><p>32 GB&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td style="width:160px;"><p>CPU cores&nbsp;</p></td><td style="width:138px;"><p>4&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td style="width:160px;"><p>Storage Space&nbsp;</p></td><td style="width:138px;"><p>262 GB&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td style="width:160px;"><p>Upload file limit&nbsp;</p></td><td style="width:138px;"><p>1 GB&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h4><span class="fontColorBlue">Ownership </span>&nbsp;</h4><p>Hosted Shiny apps must be owned by an <strong>individual researcher</strong>, who is responsible for supporting the app and is the point of contact for RCP and ITS RS.&nbsp;For public Shiny apps, the lab head will be CC’ed on all communications. If at any point the researcher leaves WEHI, new ownership will be appointed by the lab head.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4><span class="fontColorBlue">Access to Milton File System&nbsp;</span></h4><p>Both Shiny servers will not have access to Milton File Systems. Local server storage is the only storage accessible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4><span class="fontColorBlue">Storage and Code Management &nbsp;</span></h4><p>The storage will <strong><span class="fontColorBlue">not be backed up</span></strong>. Researchers are required to back up their code and data. <strong>Using a cloud-based git service for the source code is encouraged, and&nbsp;a&nbsp;copy of the data should be stored in managed Milton storage.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>WEHI reserves the right to change the way apps are hosted, which may change the app URL. Individual Shiny apps will not be supported in perpetuity and are expected to be retired eventually. The hosting of Shiny apps whose ongoing value can be demonstrated will be extended.&nbsp;</p><p>For published Shiny apps, the current best practice and the recommended solution is <strong>to host a landing page external to WEHI and publish this URL in the paper.</strong> The app code, data, and documentation should also be made available in an external repository. If hosting changes or the resource is retired, the landing page should be updated. The external repository becomes the primary resource on retirement. You can also use the DOI minting service to create a persistent DOI for your app.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Data sharing on these servers must comply with all relevant licenses, agreements, and compliance requirements. ITS RS and RCP may seek advice from the Research Governance, Risk and Compliance Office if required.&nbsp;</strong></p><h4><span class="fontColorBlue">Support&nbsp;</span></h4><p>ITS RS will build and maintain both internal and external facing Shiny servers; <strong>ITS RS will not be responsible for maintaining researcher code.</strong> Only the latest stable version of R will be supported. R updates will occur when required with up to a month’s warning of an update via email, however, in some circumstances, such as a critical fix or security patch, the email may be sent simultaneously with the update being applied. It is the responsibility of the app developers to ensure that their app continues to function correctly after the update. The app developer is responsible for installing R packages and other software prerequisites as the servers will not have access to the modules system on Milton. The app developer is also responsible for debugging any issues related to the shiny app. Should a server hosting Shiny require rebuilding, it will be the responsibility of the app owner to reinstall their app.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span class="fontColorBlue">Hosting &nbsp;</span></h4><p><strong>Internal Shiny Server&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Researchers can request app hosting for a nominated period. If space is not constrained, allocations , as indicated in the table below,&nbsp;will be approved automatically. &nbsp;Larger, or longer requests may require working with the RCP to see if the allocation can be optimised in some way. &nbsp;</p><div class="canvasRteResponsiveTable"><div class="tableCenterAlign tableWrapper"><div class="canvasRteResponsiveTable"><div class="tableWrapper"><table border="1" class="filledHeaderTableStyleTheme"><tbody><tr><td role="columnheader" style="width:267px;"><p>Purpose&nbsp;</p></td><td role="columnheader" style="width:63px;"><p>Storage Space&nbsp;</p></td><td role="columnheader" style="width:301px;"><p>Recommended Hosting Duration&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td style="width:267px;"><p>Project/Collaboration Data Sharing&nbsp;</p></td><td style="width:63px;"><p>5 GB&nbsp;</p></td><td style="width:301px;"><p>6 months&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td style="width:267px;"><p>Accompanying Publications&nbsp;</p></td><td style="width:63px;"><p>5 GB&nbsp;</p></td><td style="width:301px;"><p>3 - 5 years or according to publisher requirement&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></div><p>Academic approval may be sought for large or long-term quotas through the IT Governance Committee.&nbsp; Extending hosting is requested in a similar fashion.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Public Shiny Server&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Only lab heads can request public-facing app hosting, as these apps will be open to the world and should comply with WEHI standards; and the lab head will be copied in all communications regarding the app hosting. Otherwise, the request procedure is the same as the above.&nbsp; Extending hosting is requested in a similar fashion.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Time extensions are allowed and are treated like new hosting requests.&nbsp;</strong></p><h4><span class="fontColorBlue">Reclaiming orphaned apps &nbsp;</span></h4><p>When the nominated duration of hosting has passed, RCP will contact the lab to discuss decommissioning or extension. If the app owner is uncontactable, unresponsive, or has left the institute, the owner's lab head will be approached. If the lab head has left the institute the responsibility will devolve to the division head. If no case is made for an extension within 1-month the app will be deleted.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
