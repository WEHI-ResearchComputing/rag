<h2>Software used for research purposes</h2><p>Software is an essential part of research and has been for a long time.&nbsp;WEHI researchers use scientific software&nbsp;everyday and often&nbsp;develop&nbsp;their own&nbsp;software.&nbsp;</p><p>The importance of software for WEHI research can be observed from WEHI Nature publications in the figure in the right-hand column. Note that for 2021, the number is only up to mid-July.</p><p>The Research Computing Platform (RCP)&nbsp;can collaborate with you and your lab on&nbsp;software engineering aspects of your research and help you convert your ideas into tools. RCP provides a range of services from automating repetitive processes, building tools, modifying open source software on which you rely, making early research tools available to a wide audience.</p><p>For more ambitious projects&nbsp;we can help specify and design the solution and co-supervise the software engineers who build it. We can also recruit and co-supervise&nbsp;student interns.</p>
<p>All of the RCP team have significant research engineering experience in our backgrounds so, if you have thought, "<strong><em>I wish there was a bit of software to do such and such</em></strong>" or "<em><strong>I wish this bit of software had this feature</strong></em>", please get in touch with&nbsp;<strong><a href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" data-cke-saved-href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" data-interception="off" title="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" target="_blank">Research Computing</a>&nbsp;</strong>for a chat.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p>
