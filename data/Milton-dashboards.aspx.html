They are developed and maintained by the RCP team with the support of the ITS Systems team. Dashboards will be added as the need arises.</p><p><strong>Please note</strong> <strong>that you need to be logged in to WEHI's network or VPN (Global Protect) for the link to activate.</strong></p><p>A <a data-interception="off" title="http://dashboards.hpc.wehi.edu.au/d/fs/filesystem" href="http://dashboards.hpc.wehi.edu.au/d/fs/filesystem" data-cke-saved-href="http://dashboards.hpc.wehi.edu.au/d/fs/filesystem" target="_blank">new dashboard</a> was recently added and can be found on the FileSystem tab:&nbsp;<span class="fontColorBlue"><em>VAST Scratch Area Utilisation</em></span>.</p><p>Currently, there are four dashboards.</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">The Milton dashboards main page</span></h3><p><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">​​​​​​​</span>When you access the Milton dashboards URL you arrive on&nbsp;the home page. (Note the URL prefix&nbsp;is http, not https).</p><p><a href="http://dashboards.hpc.wehi.edu.au/" data-cke-saved-href="http://dashboards.hpc.wehi.edu.au/" title="http://dashboards.hpc.wehi.edu.au/" data-interception="off" target="_blank">http://dashboards.hpc.wehi.edu.au</a></p><p>The home page shows the main menu, which lists all the dashboards available, as seen below:</p>

<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Available dashboards</span></h3><p>The four available dashboards are:<br><br></p><ul><li>FileSystem</li><li>RStudio Servers</li><li>SLURM</li><li>User Queue Details.</li></ul><p>The image gallery below shows a screenshot of each dashboard with a brief explanation of its features. Click the arrow on the mid-right of each image to scroll through the gallery and see a screenshot (with accompanying information) of all 4 dashboards.</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">(1) The FileSystem dashboard</span></h3><p>Shows the utilisation percentage of each partition on the different filesystems. There are two vertical tabs, VAST and Stornext, which can be expanded or collapsed.</p><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">(2) RStudio Servers dashboard</span></h3><p>This dashboard shows different utilisation of the two RStudio servers with respect to CPU, Memory and /tmp. You can also see a per user utilisation.</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">(3) The SLURM dashboard</span></h3><p>This dashboard has two tabs:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>SLURM Cluster</li><li>SLURM Jobs.</li></ol><p><br></p>
<p>The <strong><span class="fontColorBlue">SLURM Cluster</span></strong> tab shows an overall view of the SLURM CPUs, Memory and GPUs utilisation.<br></p><p>The <strong><span class="fontColorBlue">SLURM Jobs</span></strong> tab gives a snapshot of the state of the SLURM queue currently.</p><p>Availability of resources determines whether a job starts running or is held in a pending state. On Milton SLURM, <a data-cke-saved-href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/priority_multifactor.html" href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/priority_multifactor.html" target="_blank" title="https://slurm.schedmd.com/priority_multifactor.html" data-interception="off">multi-factor priority scheduling</a> with <a data-cke-saved-href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/sched_config.html" href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/sched_config.html" target="_blank" title="https://slurm.schedmd.com/sched_config.html" data-interception="off">backfill</a> is used to assign job priority which affects when the job will run.</p><p>The regular QOS currently limits a single user to 256 CPU cores and 1.3TB memory, even if more resources are available. Jobs pending due to QOS are shown on the tab under QOS Pending.<br></p><p>Other parameters (jobs pending due to other factors are shown under <em>Pending</em>) are :<br>​​​​​​​</p><ul><li><strong>Fair share:</strong> the more resources your jobs are already using, the lower the priority of your next jobs.</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> the length of time a job has been waiting in the queue, as it increases the job priority increases.</li><li><strong>Resources requested: </strong>the more resources (CPUs, GPUs and memory) requested, the higher the priority.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">(4) User Queue Details</span></h3><p>This dashboard presents a snapshot of the queue per user.</p><p>This is why you have to choose a user to see that user's queue information, just as if you run the <em><span class="fontColorBlue">squeue -u &lt;username&gt; </span></em>command.</p><p>It has two tabs:</p><ol><li>Running Jobs</li><li>Other Jobs.</li></ol><p><br>​​​​​​​The <span class="fontColorBlue"><strong>Running Jobs</strong></span> tab shows the number of jobs running currently and the total amount of resources allocated to these running jobs.</p>
<p>The <strong><span class="fontColorBlue">Others</span></strong> tab shows the number of jobs not running (i.e. pending, suspended,..) currently and reason why they are not running, as show in the example above.</p>
