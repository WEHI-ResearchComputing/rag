<h2><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Introduction</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">The RCP Discovery Program is an initiative to encourage researchers across WEHI to engage with RCP in student internship projects to help discover and prototype new ideas.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">The program aims to help WEHI researchers understand and uncover new ideas' complexity and help mature them while working with student interns interested in Data Science and Software Engineering.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin-left:0px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</p><h2><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary" lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">Background</span></h2><p style="margin-left:0px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">The WEHI Research Computing Platform regularly provides student internship opportunities through the University of Melbourne Science and Engineering programs to help find and nurture talented Research Software Engineers (RSEs). These internships are 100% remote, with the Science interns averaging 1 day a week over 3 months, and the Engineering students averaging 3 days a week over 3 months.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">Many projects work in data analysis and research software engineering using high-performance computing (HPC). We work across diverse projects such as imaging, cryo-EM, genomics, transcriptomics, health informatics, and capacity planning.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">Some projects have spanned multiple intakes which has allowed these projects to mature their documentation and onboarding and to reduce the learning curve for new students.</span>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">We mainly work with projects that use R and Shiny, Python, Julia, bash, while also making the most out of other technologies such as RStudio, Jupyter notebooks, PowerBI and other applications within the data analytics space.</span>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</p><h2><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary" lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">Benefits for Researchers</span>&nbsp;</h2><p style="margin-left:0px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">Some projects that have benefited from working with students include:</span></p><ul><li><p style="margin-left:0px;"><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">exploring approaches and architectural designs to expose the complexity of difficult problems - like managing different types of research data,</span></p></li><li><p style="margin-left:0px;"><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">developing user stories, wireframes, and proof-of-concept software to provide a clearer vision of what a good solution might look like to researchers and research software engineers (RSEs),</span></p></li><li><p style="margin-left:0px;"><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">setting up onboarding and technical documentation, testing or improving infrastructure like containers to help new people use research software or research workflows, and</span></p></li><li><p style="margin-left:0px;"><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">exploring new avenues of technology and sharing documentation and suggested approaches to learning, like the Quantum Computing project.</span></p></li></ul><p style="margin-left:0px;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">This can help bridge the gap to complementary programs such as the </span><a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Capability-Building-Program.aspx"><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr"><u>RCP Capability Building program</u></span></a><span lang="EN-AU" dir="ltr">, which works on mature projects.
