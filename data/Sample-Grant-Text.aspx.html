<h2><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Grant text</span></h2><p>To include in grants when describing available resources and support. Below are two examples:</p>
<blockquote><p>WEHI Research Computing provides the necessary research computing infrastructure including a &gt;5000-core computer cluster, &gt;60TB memory, GPU farm, &gt;10 petabytes of tiered-storage, and highly-skilled engineering support through our Research Computing Platform.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p style="margin-left:48px;">WEHI Research Computing operates a robust high-performance computing cluster (HPC) equipped with over 5000 cores, more than 60TB of memory, a 58 GPU farm that includes A30s, A100s, A10s and an overall memory of more than 7TB. The HPC has an upwards of 10 petabytes of tiered storage. The HPC system employs Slurm for efficient cluster management and job scheduling.</p><p style="margin-left:48px;">Administration of the HPC platform falls under the purview of the Research Computing teams, which is composed of two teams. The ITS Research Systems (ITS RS) team, comprised of 5 FTE, is responsible for maintaining the infrastructure and overseeing the HPC environment. Meanwhile, the Research Computing Platform team, consisting of 5 FTE, provides software engineering support and collaborates closely with researchers to develop pipelines and research systems.</p></blockquote>
