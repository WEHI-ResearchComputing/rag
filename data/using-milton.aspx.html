<h2><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Connecting to Milton</span></h2><p>To get access to Milton HPC, all WEHI researchers must first submit a request via the <a href="https://support.wehi.edu.au/support/catalog/items/134">HPC access FreshService form</a><strong>.</strong></p><p>If you have a WEHI laptop/desktop, you should be able to access Milton HPC via SSH while connected to the staff network, or via the VPN. For personal non-WEHI devices, Milton is only accessible via the <a href="https://ondemand.hpc.wehi.edu.au/">Open OnDemand portal</a> (recommended) and <a href="https://rap.wehi.edu.au">RAP</a> (Remote Access Portal). Like many other HPC facilities, Milton is accessible either through the command-line, or Open OnDemand interactive sessions.</p><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Open OnDemand Interactive Sessions</span></h3><p>Historically, traditional HPC was accessible only via the command line. However, many workflows require or benefit from a GUI to interact with and/or analyse results. <strong>Open OnDemand </strong>enables a Desktop-like interface on HPC, and also enables using interactive software like Jupyter or RStudio on HPC.</p><p>To access OnDemand on Milton, you will first need to have access to the Milton HPC. Once this is set up, you will be able to access OnDemand at <a href="https://ondemand.hpc.wehi.edu.au/">https://ondemand.hpc.wehi.edu.au/</a> (no WEHI network/VPN needed)</p><p>​​​​​​​See more on how to use OnDemand on Milton <a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Interactive-workloads.aspx#open-ondemand"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">ssh (Command-line) Sessions (SLURM)</span></h3><p>If you are using a non-WEHI device, you can only <strong>connect to Milton via RAP</strong> and then clicking on RDP-SSH and then "SSH - slurm-login".</p><p><strong><u>On a WEHI Mac:</u></strong></p><p>You can open a terminal and type the command</p><pre>ssh vc7-shared\n</pre><p>which will prompt you for your WEHI password. Note that when typing your password, for security reasons, characters will not be visible. When done typing your password, press enter and you will have logged into Milton. Below is an example of what to expect from the command. Note that if it is your first time connecting to Milton this way, you will be prompted to confirm that you would like to connect.</p><div class="imagePlugin" style="background-color:transparent;position:relative;" data-alignment="Center" data-imageurl="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SiteAssets/SitePages/using-milton/3972850652.png" data-isdecorative="false" data-imagenaturalheight="582" data-imagenaturalwidth="812" data-siteid="93ee3842-f21b-4d8d-b85b-874e64c67802" data-webid="95711e2c-a16f-49a8-9adc-1b9756d4ee5e" data-listid="3d75202a-c480-42f5-abb7-5e7b39fc27d5" data-uniqueid="8cbf6b0d-0e58-4ce3-9bcd-31be6197dbea" data-height="311.0741930706571" data-width="434.0072934250405" data-widthpercentage="36.65505394600358"></div><p><strong><u>On a WEHI Windows machine:</u></strong></p><p>For Windows 10 and 11, you may first need to enable OpenSSH.

<h2><span class="fontColorThemePrimary">Choosing How to Connect</span></h2><p>When you are starting a new compute project, it is always difficult to choose which compute option to use and where to start. In this article, we will try to help you make a decision.</p><p>You might need to start by considering:</p><ul><li>The amount of data to be processed and where it is stored.</li><li>The tools to be used and whether they are available on the modules system.</li><li>What resources such as memory, CPU cores, and possibly GPUs are required.</li><li>How do you want to run your jobs, interactively or in the batch system?<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>​​If you are starting a new analysis, you might need to start with a sample/test dataset and run interactively to understand the tools, fine-tune your scripts and estimate how many resources your full job will require.&nbsp;</p><p>It is good to look for threading options in the tools you use, or explore running in parallel if possible (more about that&nbsp;<a href="/sites/RCPNewsletter/SitePages/June-2021-Issue.aspx#use-tech" data-interception="off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). Parallel execution is usually easy if your job contains repeated independent steps. If you need help developing/designing your workload or writing scripts, don't hesitate to email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" data-interception="off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research Computing</a><strong>​​​​​.</strong></p><p>The table below will help you choose a Milton alternative to run your jobs. They are guidelines for starting but other factors may come into play. As always, talk to us if you have any questions!</p>

<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">External resources</span></h3><p>Milton may not be the best option for your workload. Reasons to look at external options include:<br><br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>You need to process a large external dataset</li><li>Your workload is too big for Milton</li><li>Milton does not offer a processing paradigm for your workload.</li></ul><p>Moving large datasets into WEHI is slow, cumbersome, possibly expensive and we may simply not have the storage available. Increasingly, data is being made available in clouds such as AWS and Google Cloud Platform. In these cases, it may be possible to "bring the compute to the data" and do the processing in the cloud as well. The data provider will be able to advise on that. Cloud compute is expensive so you will need to fund it. There may be specific grants available for your work. Speak to your lab head, the Research Grants Office, and Research Computing.</p><p>For workloads that are too big for Milton, you may be able to get time on <a href="https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/" data-interception="off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spartan</a>. Staff with University of Melbourne honorary appointments working with university researchers and university post-graduate students can apply for accounts. It is also possible to apply for an allocation on <a href="https://pawsey.org.au/" data-interception="off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pawsey</a> or <a href="https://nci.org.au/" data-interception="off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NCI</a>. Unfortunately, there is a hurdle in that minimum allocation is typically too large for a single project. However, talk to Research Computing as there may be others in a similar position and it may be possible to make a combined application.</p><p>Workloads that do not fit into the Milton catalogue of services will need to be processed elsewhere. An example is a workload that requires a particular cloud resource, such as a customised machine image. ITS can <a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/accessing-cloud.aspx">fund small pilot projects</a> but for large projects, you may need to find funding.
