<h2><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Multi-Cloud Project</span></h2><p>As research datasets grow in size and complexity,&nbsp;security concerns grow&nbsp;consequently,&nbsp;especially when sensitive data is involved.&nbsp;Some institutes and organisations have started using cloud providers to build secure platforms where sensitive and/or clinical data reside and can be processed. An example is the&nbsp;<strong><a title="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" data-interception="off" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">UK BioBank</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a title="https://amp-pd.org/" data-interception="off" data-cke-saved-href="https://amp-pd.org/" href="https://amp-pd.org/">AMP Parkinson's&nbsp;Disease</a></strong>&nbsp;which uses&nbsp;<strong><a title="https://terra.bio/" data-interception="off" data-cke-saved-href="https://terra.bio/" href="https://terra.bio/">Terra.bio&nbsp;</a></strong>and&nbsp;<strong><a title="https://www.dnanexus.com/" data-interception="on" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.dnanexus.com/" href="https://www.dnanexus.com/">DNAnexus</a></strong>&nbsp;for data analysis. Both make use of public cloud providers. In addition to that, researchers occasionally need more powerful resources&nbsp;or a huge number of&nbsp;resources that are not available in their internal HPCs.</p><p>Research Computing is running a multi-cloud pilot&nbsp;to focus on answering some of the key questions around understanding the best options for researchers and also increasing oversight of cloud utilisation. We understand that there is no one-solution-fits-all, and that is why this pilot includes multiple projects and covers multiple cloud providers</p><p>The pilot will attempt to identify key governance needs for researchers and professional staff for current use cases and beyond, and the focus will be on accessing compute resources and storage for research workflows.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you are currently using any of the cloud providers, please get in contact with&nbsp;<strong><a title="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" data-interception="off" data-cke-saved-href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au">Research Computing</a></strong>, to discuss how including you in the WEHI cloud organisation structure will benefit your projects and provide access to more discounted services and offers.</p><p>So far we are providing support to Bahlo lab on their research project that uses data from AMP-PD and processes it on Terra.bio. We are also supporting the Colonial Foundation Healthy Aging Center in building a secure platform using AWS Service Workbench.&nbsp;</p><p>A brief on the projects and RCP engagement is described <strong><a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/RCP-Projects.aspx#secure-data-platforms-on-the-cloud" data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/RCP-Projects.aspx#secure-data-platforms-on-the-cloud" data-interception="on" title="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/RCP-Projects.aspx#secure-data-platforms-on-the-cloud">here</a></strong>.</p>
