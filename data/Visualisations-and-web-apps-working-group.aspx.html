<h2><strong>​​​​​​​</strong>Visualisations and web apps working group</h2><p>The ability to publish small web apps and visualisations (like R/Shiny apps) is not fully supported at WEHI either in terms of policy or infrastructure. A few weeks ago, we sent out a survey to get a broad understanding of&nbsp;needs and to solicit volunteers to join a working group. A summary of the results is&nbsp;<strong><a title="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchComputingSteeringGroup/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?viewid=adcb5c5d-e083-432b-a918-53884bd1a5ae&amp;id=/sites/ResearchComputingSteeringGroup/Shared%20Documents/Web%20Apps%20Working%20Group/Suvey%20Results.pdf&amp;parent=/sites/ResearchComputingSteeringGroup/Shared%20Documents/Web%20Apps%20Working%20Group" data-interception="off" data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchComputingSteeringGroup/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?viewid=adcb5c5d-e083-432b-a918-53884bd1a5ae&amp;id=/sites/ResearchComputingSteeringGroup/Shared%20Documents/Web%20Apps%20Working%20Group/Suvey%20Results.pdf&amp;parent=/sites/ResearchComputingSteeringGroup/Shared%20Documents/Web%20Apps%20Working%20Group" href="/sites/ResearchComputingSteeringGroup/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?viewid=adcb5c5d-e083-432b-a918-53884bd1a5ae&amp;id=/sites/ResearchComputingSteeringGroup/Shared%20Documents/Web%20Apps%20Working%20Group/Suvey%20Results.pdf&amp;parent=/sites/ResearchComputingSteeringGroup/Shared%20Documents/Web%20Apps%20Working%20Group">here</a></strong>.</p><p>Researchers would like to publish a variety of apps from interactive visualisations, analysis tools, and reports. They need to reach a variety of audiences ranging from the general research community to access controlled&nbsp;collaborators. While R/Shiny is a popular technology, there are (too) many others.&nbsp;</p><p>A number of people expressed interest in joining a working group and we are in the process of sending out invitations. The first task of the group will be to develop a broad understanding of requirements and then dig into what might reasonably be delivered.<br></p><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">The&nbsp;Research Data Governance Steering Committee (RDGSC)</span></h3><p>There is a newly formed steering committee called the Research Data Governance Steering Committee (RDGSC), which is&nbsp;there to&nbsp;provide leadership, direction, and oversight to the planning and&nbsp;management of research data governance, and also&nbsp;to ensure ongoing alignment with the institute’s objectives by delivering value and efficiency.</p><p>The RDGSC is due to meet for the first time in July. <br></p><p>If you have any questions or comments about the RDGSC, please contact Rowland Mosbergen (<a href="mailto:mosbergen.r@wehi.edu.au" data-cke-saved-href="mailto:mosbergen.r@wehi.edu.au" title="mailto:mosbergen.r@wehi.edu.au" target="_blank" data-interception="off">mosbergen.r@wehi.edu.au</a>).&nbsp;</p>
