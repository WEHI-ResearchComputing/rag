<h2>Provisioning and managing interactive VMs</h2><h3><span class="fontColorThemeDark">Request a VM for your division, lab, or project</span></h3><p>If there is a group of people, for example, a lab or a group of collaborators working on a lengthy project, you can request a VM for this group. This can be provisioned on a long-term basis with the resources you require. It is then up to the members of the group to manage resource use in this VM. Nominated members of the group will have the ability to kill other users' jobs and reboot the system.</p><p>Please contact <a title="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" data-interception="off" data-cke-saved-href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au">Research Computing</a> to discuss your requirement(s).<br></p>

<p>The main operating systems and configurations are:<br><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Bioinf - Centos 6 (Server):</strong> A CentOS 6 (Linux) node that resembles the legacy bioinformatics and population health servers (unix3xx and unix4xx servers). Only use this if you have a dependency on this specific version of CentOS otherwise use the equivalent CentOS 7 template.</p></li><li><p><strong>HPC - Centos 7 (Server):</strong> A CentOS 7 (Linux) compute node with a <span class="fontColorBlue"><em>/stornext/HPCScratch/home/&lt;userid&gt;</em></span> home area (the same as the old Torque compute nodes).</p></li><li><p><strong>SeqMonk:</strong> Preinstalled with the Seqmonk program (Java) as a full-screen web app using <a data-cke-saved-href="https://guacamole.apache.org/" href="https://guacamole.apache.org/" target="_blank" title="https://guacamole.apache.org/" data-interception="off">Guacamole</a> and X windows in a kiosk mode. It has access to the shared filesystems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Structbio - Global Phasing Centos 7:</strong> Centos 7 with HPC Scratch home area. Global Phasing structural biology software included. The software will only work with this template.</p></li><li><p><strong>SysBio - MSCypher Windows Server 2012 r2:</strong> MSCypher program installed on Windows 2012 r2.</p></li><li><p><strong>HPC - Centos 7 (with VNC):</strong> As above but with the same file system as the Structural Biology Unix desktops.</p></li><li><p><strong>WEHI - Windows 7 (Blank):</strong> Windows 7 joined to the WEHI Active Directory domain.</p></li><li><p><strong>WEHI - Ubuntu 16</strong>: Ubuntu 16.04 Server with the standard Unix home.</p></li></ul><p><strong><span class="fontColorRed">Note:</span></strong> Nothing is kept in the VM, all data is saved to the main WEHI filesystems so machines can be destroyed and recreated without losing data, as long as the data is saved to files.</p><p>Please consider other alternatives:<br><br></p><ul><li>Work that is not interactive can be run in <a data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Getting-started-Slurm.aspx" href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Getting-started-Slurm.aspx" title="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Getting-started-Slurm.aspx" data-interception="on">SLURM</a> batch system.</li><li>Light <a data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Interactive-workloads.aspx" href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Interactive-workloads.aspx" title="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Interactive-workloads.aspx" data-interception="on">interactive work</a> can be run on a shared resource, such as vc7-shared or using interactive batch sessions.</li><li>Consider requesting a lab or project VM that can be shared between a number of people.

<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">How to provision a VM at WEHI</span></h3><ol><li>â€‹Navigate to this webpage and login with your WEHI username and password: <a href="https://vra.wehi.edu.au/vcac/org/milton" data-cke-saved-href="https://vra.wehi.edu.au/vcac/org/milton">https://vra.wehi.edu.au/vcac/org/milton</a></li><li>Select catalog from the tab bar (see figure 1)</li><li>Select the machine type and click REQUEST.</li><li>Specify how the machine should live and resources required (figure 2)</li><li>Click the submit button.</li><li>When the machine is provisioned you will receive an email and you will be able to see the machine under items (figure 3)</li><li>Clicking the machine name will bring a up display showing details and providing options to manage the machine (figure 4).</li><li>For unix machines, you can login from a terminal in your desktop using the fully qualified domain name, that is the machine name plus '.hpc.wehi.edu.au'. In the example below this would be vc7hpc-011.hpc.wehi.edu.au. For windows, use a remote desktop client.</li></ol>
<h2>vRA requests - after submission</h2><p>Once a vRA request has been submitted, two entries will appear in the deployment list (in most cases):</p><ol><li>the actual VM; and</li><li>the approval for the VM.</li></ol><p>The entries look similar to the screenshot below:</p>
<ul><li>The top entry is the clone.</li><li>The bottom entry is the approval which can be dismissed (once it is successful) by clicking 'Actions' on the right hand side of the box.</li></ul><p>If the deployment becomes grey and does not proceed, it means your VM is on hold for approval until it has resources to provision.</p><h2>Cloud resources</h2><p>There are use cases for provisioning resources in an off-premise cloud, for example, specialised images for training. Please discuss your use case with <a href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" data-cke-saved-href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" target="_blank" data-interception="off" title="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au">Research Computing</a>.</p>
