<h2><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Computing Drop-in</span></h2><p>The WEHI Computing Drop-in is a friendly&nbsp;weekly event run by the <i>Research Computing Platform </i>that anyone can attend to ask research computing questions. Popular topics for discussion include <span class="fontColorNeutralDark"><strong>high-performance computing (HPC), Slurm usage, cloud computing, general programming, R, Python, package development, code optimisation, data processing, data storage, and data management</strong>.</span></p><p>Starting in 2024, <span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr">the </span><a href="/sites/resources/SitePages/Bioinformatics-Support-Unit.aspx"><span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr">Bioinformatics Support Facility</span></a><span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr"> has joined the Computing Drop-in to answer questions about bioinformatics analyses<strong> </strong>including <strong>genomics, RNA-seq, </strong></span><strong>scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq</strong><span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr"><strong>, </strong></span><strong>ChIP-seq</strong><span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr"><strong>, spatial omics, biostatistics and more.</strong></span></p><p>In addition, the <a href="/sites/Bioimageanalysis/SitePages/Bioimage-Analysis-Core.aspx">Bioimage Analysis Core</a> will be attending every second Computing Drop-in to provide assistance with tasks such as <strong>image segmentation and quantification, image registration, object tracking, spatial transcriptomics analysis, data analysis and visualization, and application of AI/ML in image analysis. </strong>Please refer to the weekly reminder emails to see if bioimage help will be available on any given week.</p><p>Asking questions isn't the only way to participate in the Drop-in. You can also use this hour to work on a computing project with support at hand to help with issues as they arise. Also, if you're experienced in computing topics, you're share your expertise by answering questions as well! In this way, the Computing Drop-ins are similar to Hacky Hours run at other Australian universities.</p><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Schedule and Venue</span></h3><p>The Drop-in runs<span class="fontColorBlue"> </span><strong>every Tuesday at 2 pm</strong>. The physical venue is the level 7 tearoom, at the tables next to the couches (see image below).
