From the VM home page request one of the servers that you need to perform your work.</p><p>2a. Click the 'request' link and complete the online form.</p><p>2b. Complete the form and click the 'submit' button.</p><p>3. The 'Deployments' screen will appear and displays a blue bar indicating the progress next to the VM name.</p><p>4. A percentage bar will appear, however, please note that the percentage bar is only a guideline of how much time is required to provision your chosen VM, and is not verbatim.</p><p>5. In general a request should be fulfilled within a short space of time (less than 30mins), however, there are factors that can affect the time it takes for a job to complete, eg. high workload, multiple requests, system trying to find available resources, etc.</p><p>6. Occasionally your request may get greyed out and say ‘<em>pending approval’</em>. Don’t worry if this happens, it just means the system is finding resources for you and your request is in progress.</p><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Recommendation</span></h3><p>The Research Computing Team would like to recommend that when a request to provision a VM is submitted, please be patient and give the system some time to complete your job.</p><p>Most requests are usually fulfilled within a 40-minute timeframe but if your request takes longer to complete, please contact the <a href="mailto:support@wehi.edu.au" data-cke-saved-href="mailto:support@wehi.edu.au" target="_blank" data-interception="off" title="mailto:support@wehi.edu.au">Helpdesk</a> so they can investigate further.<br></p>
