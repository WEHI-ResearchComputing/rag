<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">UNIX concepts, the UNIX command line and shell scripting</span></h3><p>The primary way of interacting with Unix systems (which are almost universally Linux these days) is via the command line. Mac OSX also has an excellent command-line interface available through the Terminal program. Once comfortable with the command line you should learn the basics of shell scripting which will allow you to make new commands to help with your work, automate repetitive tasks and manage complex workflows.</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">​​​​​​UNIX editors</span></h3><p>You will need to edit text files as part of your work. UNIX text editors originated in a world where there were no graphical user interfaces and are an arcane world unto themselves. There are some relatively easy-to-use editors:</p><ul><li><a href="https://joe-editor.sourceforge.io/" data-cke-saved-href="https://joe-editor.sourceforge.io/" target="_blank" title="https://joe-editor.sourceforge.io/" data-interception="off">joe</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nano-editor.org/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.nano-editor.org/" target="_blank" title="https://www.nano-editor.org/" data-interception="off">nano</a>&nbsp;<br><br></li></ul><p><span class="fontColorBlue"><em>vi</em></span> or <span class="fontColorBlue"><em>vim</em></span> are very popular and powerful editors but difficult to learn. Here are some introductory guides.</p><ul><li><a href="https://vim-adventures.com/" data-cke-saved-href="https://vim-adventures.com/" target="_blank" title="https://vim-adventures.com/" data-interception="off">Vim adventures</a></li><li><a href="http://www.openvim.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.openvim.com/" target="_blank" title="http://www.openvim.com/" data-interception="off">Open Vim</a></li></ul><p>In addition, vim comes with built in training. At the command line type <em><span class="fontColorBlue">vimtutor</span></em>.</p><p><strong>Power users aspire to Emacs:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/" target="_blank" title="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/" data-interception="off">www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/</a></li><li><a href="http://www.jesshamrick.com/2012/09/10/absolute-beginners-guide-to-emacs/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.jesshamrick.com/2012/09/10/absolute-beginners-guide-to-emacs/" target="_blank" title="http://www.jesshamrick.com/2012/09/10/absolute-beginners-guide-to-emacs/" data-interception="off">www.jesshamrick.com/2012/09/10/absolute-beginners-guide-to-emacs/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" title="https://www.sublimetext.com/" data-interception="off">Sublime Text</a> is a popular editor on Mac OSX and Windows PCs. It is a commercial product so you need to purchase a licence (or get your lab head to buy it for you). There is a version available for Linux but you need to set up an X server on your PC and use X-windows tunnelling when connecting to the target system (not covered here).<br><br></p><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Programming languages</span><br></h3><p>Modern science involves the exploration and visualisation of complex data. This can only be accomplished by writing your own programs. There are many languages and language ecosystems used in science and engineering but the main ones used at WEHI are <a href="https://www.python.org" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank" title="https://www.python.org" data-interception="off">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Using cloud services</span></h3><p>Qwiklabs provides very good guided training for Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Each lesson is run using temporary credentials so you don’t need to pay for cloud usage during training and can work through the lesson on the live systems.</p><p>200 Qwiklab credits are available through Google on application for educational&nbsp;use, training, or self-teaching for academic staff, and to students for self-teaching.&nbsp;5000 are available if you are training people in a course.</p><p><a href="https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/training/?modal_active=none" data-cke-saved-href="https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/training/?modal_active=none" target="_blank" data-interception="off" title="https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/training/?modal_active=none">Click here</a> for more information about Google training credits.<br><br></p><h4>Acknowledgements</h4><p>I would like to thank Ismael Vergara, Jakub Munro, Christoffer Flensburg and Liam Fernley for many of the links suggested here.</p>
