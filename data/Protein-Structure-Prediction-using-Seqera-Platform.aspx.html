<h2><span class="fontColorThemePrimary">AlphaFold using Nextflow</span></h2><p>RCP has developed a nextflow pipeline to run Alphafold on Milton.

<h3><span class="fontColorThemePrimary">Getting access to the WEHI workspace on Seqera Platform</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://seqera.io/platform/" data-interception="off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seqera Platform</a> is the centralized command post for the management of <a href="https://www.nextflow.io/">Nextflow</a> data pipelines. It offers monitoring, logging, and observability for distributed workflows and simplifies the deployment of pipelines on any cloud, cluster, or laptop.</p><p>Users can launch pre-configured pipelines with ease. Workflow developers can publish pipelines to shared workspaces and administrators can set up and manage the infrastructure required to run data analysis at scale.</p><p aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</p><p>To get access to WEHI's workspaces, please follow the instructions <a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Nextflow-Tower.aspx" data-interception="off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>here</strong></a> and request access to WEHI workspace.</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemePrimary">Running Alphafold Pipeline in Seqera Platform</span></h3>
<p>Before using the pipeline, you need to prepare your fasta files and get the full path to the directory that includes all sequences you want to fold.</p><p>Further details <a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/AlphaFold.aspx#prepare-protein-sequence-file" data-interception="off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>After gaining access to WEHI workspace and logging in, choose <span class="fontColorBlue">WEHI</span> workspace, and from the list of pipelines in the <span class="fontColorBlue">Launchpad</span> choose <span class="fontColorBlue">ProteinStructurePrediction</span>, then press <span class="fontColorBlue">Launch</span>.</p>
<p>Then fill the form with the pipeline parameters. Description and examples for each fielsd are displayed below the field. Once all is filled, press Launch.</p><p>Outputdir and inputdir should be a full absolute path.</p>
<p>You can monitor the status of your running pipelines from the <a href="https://seqera.services.biocommons.org.au/orgs/BioCommons/workspaces/WEHI/watch" data-interception="off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Runs tab</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you can further check the status by clicking on your pipeline and you will get a report on how many tasks has finished and how many still being processed. If the pipeline has completed successfully, you will see a report on resource utilisation.</p>
