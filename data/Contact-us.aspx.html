<h2><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Getting support</span></h2><p>The best mechanism for getting support is through the Helpdesk rather than contacting individuals. This <a title="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/tech/SitePages/Getting-help.aspx" data-interception="off" data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/tech/SitePages/Getting-help.aspx" href="/sites/tech/SitePages/Getting-help.aspx">Catalyst document</a> describes the numerous ways to contact the Helpdesk or raise a ticket.</p><p><span class="fontColorRedDark"><strong>Note:</strong></span> ITS only provide support between <span class="fontColorBlue"><strong>9am-5pm</strong></span> on working days, i.e. business hours.</p><p>Helpdesk staff can quickly triage your problem and direct it to the correct team or individual. Tickets also help ITS manage issues that are affecting many users and analyse historical trends.</p><p>For urgent problems, ring the Helpdesk on 2589. For less urgent problems raise a ticket by emailing <a data-interception="off" title="mailto:support@wehi.edu.au" href="mailto:support@wehi.edu.au" data-cke-saved-href="mailto:support@wehi.edu.au">support@wehi.edu.au</a>.&nbsp;If your ticket has not been responded to in a time frame that is reasonable, in <em>your</em> judgement, follow up by replying to the ticket.</p><p>When raising a ticket provide as much information as you <em>reasonably</em> can:<br><br></p><ul><li>The software you were using</li><li>How you were using it, e.g. the exact command</li><li>The system you were using&nbsp;</li><li>What triggered the issue or what was happening when the issue occurred</li><li>Copy and paste, or attach logs,&nbsp;error messages, and/or screenshots</li><li>Does this seem similar to an issue you've had in the past?</li></ul>
