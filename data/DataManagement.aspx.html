<h2><span class="fontColorNeutralDark">Data management</span></h2><p>WEHI has different <a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Data-how-to-store.aspx" data-cke-saved-href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Data-how-to-store.aspx" data-interception="on" title="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Data-how-to-store.aspx">filesystems</a>&nbsp;that may be managed in different ways to account for all requirements. Some filesystems have quotas set on them like&nbsp;Home areas.</p><p><strong>Data tiering</strong><span>&nbsp;is employed to manage the institute's data storage requirements. As the amount of data vastly exceeds the amount of available hard disk, all new or updated data is copied from disk to the tape tier on a nightly basis, thus any file which has been copied to tape may be safely truncated from disk. Files that have previously been truncated&nbsp;may easily be retrieved.</span>​​​​​​​</p><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Store policy</span></h3><p>At WEHI the store policies for all managed filesystems are as follows:<br><br></p><ol><li>Copies are attempted each night. The system cannot guarantee that it will be able to process all the candidate files depending on factors such&nbsp;as the number of files, size of files, and how busy it is with retrieves, as these have a higher priority for resources.</li><li>One copy is made to the tape library residing in the Parkville data centre (copy 1) and the second copy is made to the data centre at Melbourne University (copy 2).</li><li>If the file is modified this will change the version number. As such the data will be stored as if it's a new file, but associated with the original. Fourteen such copies of the file are kept so that they can be easily reverted to.<br><br><span class="fontColorRed"><strong>Please note</strong></span> that most editors and programs actually create a new file, copy the data, and delete the original (eg. <strong>vim</strong> does this by default). Such files will remain at version 1 and the previous one will&nbsp;need to be recovered, rather than revision changed.</li></ol>
<p>If the filesystem becomes 100% full then <span class="fontColorYellowLight"><strong>emergency</strong></span> truncation will occur.</p><p>The system needs space to allow for data flow to continue, so it will truncate files at random to get back to its watermark (now set at 95% full) as fast as it can.
