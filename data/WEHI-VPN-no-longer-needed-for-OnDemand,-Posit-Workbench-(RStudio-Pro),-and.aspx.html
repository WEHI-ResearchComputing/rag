<p>In January, ITS made Milton OnDemand, Posit Workbench (RStudio Pro) and VRA services available outside of WEHI's VPN. This means researchers no longer need to go through RAP to use Milton. Instead, everyone can enter the following links into their browser and access the resources directly, making them easier to access:</p><ul><li>OnDemand: <a data-cke-saved-href="https://ondemand.hpc.wehi.edu.au" href="https://ondemand.hpc.wehi.edu.au">https://ondemand.hpc.wehi.edu.au</a></li><li>Posit Workbench (RStudio Pro): <a data-cke-saved-href="https://rstudio.hpc.wehi.edu.au" href="https://rstudio.hpc.wehi.edu.au">https://rstudio.hpc.wehi.edu.au</a></li><li>VRA (Virtual Machine provisioning service): <a href="https://vra.hpc.wehi.edu.au" data-cke-saved-href="https://vra.hpc.wehi.edu.au" data-interception="on" title="https://vra.hpc.wehi.edu.au">https://vra.hpc.wehi.edu.au</a></li><li>CryoSparc: <a href="https://cryosparc.hpc.wehi.edu.au" data-cke-saved-href="https://cryosparc.hpc.wehi.edu.au" data-interception="on" title="https://cryosparc.hpc.wehi.edu.au">https://cryosparc.hpc.wehi.edu.au</a></li></ul><p>If you're having issues accessing these resources, please send a helpdesk ticket to support@wehi.edu.au.</p>
