<h2>Accessing cloud</h2><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">What is the cloud?</span></h3><blockquote><p><span class="fontColorNeutralDark">Cloud computing is a paradigm whereby computational resources such as computers, storage and bandwidth can be rented on a pay-for-what-you-use basis</span></p></blockquote><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Cloud access at WEHI</span></h3><p>There is currently no ITS budget to fund cloud projects. Nevertheless, please come and talk to us if you have a project that requires cloud access because there may be an opportunity to work with cloud vendors on proof of concept projects.</p><p>Typical use cases are:<br><br></p><ul><li>Machines with unsupported networking such as public-facing web services</li><li>Complex and unsupported software for which images exist in the cloud</li><li>Unsupported operating systems or environments</li><li>Machine types that we don't have on-premise</li><li>Hardware not supported on-premise, such as specific GPU models or field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)</li><li>Creating and provisioning systems for teaching</li><li>Analysing data stored in clouds, directly in the cloud.</li></ul>
