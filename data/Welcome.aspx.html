<h2><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Welcome everyone!</span></h2><p>Research Computing (RC) is thrilled to announce the launch of our revamped website (2021), designed to serve all WEHI staff who use or plan to use, our high-performance computer (HPC) - affectionately known as Milton.</p><p>Our new website boasts a fresh look and incorporates cutting-edge technology, offering numerous new features, such as forms, lists, Twitter feeds, videos, and more.</p><p>We have carefully designed the site based on the invaluable feedback we received from the card sorting survey conducted during <strong><span class="fontColorBlue">May-June 2021</span></strong>. The overwhelming response to the survey has greatly informed the organization and placement of information on the site, ensuring a more user-friendly experience.</p><p>With this intuitive layout, we are confident that you will be able to find the information you need with ease. We encourage all WEHI staff to explore the new website, discover its features, and take advantage of the improved resources it offers for utilizing Milton and other RC services.</p><p>As always, we welcome your feedback and suggestions on how we can continue to enhance our website and better serve your research computing needs.</p>
<p>WEHI Research Computing (RC) is made up of two teams: IT Research&nbsp;Systems&nbsp;(ITS RS) and&nbsp;<strong><a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Research-Computing-Platform.aspx" data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Research-Computing-Platform.aspx" target="_blank" data-interception="off" title="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Research-Computing-Platform.aspx">Research Computing Platform</a></strong> (RCP). Contact information for these teams can be found &nbsp;<a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Contact-us.aspx" data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Contact-us.aspx"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Research Computing (RC) teams at WEHI are dedicated to providing researchers with the necessary computational and human resources to successfully advance their research projects. We are committed to supporting your scientific research by offering fast and efficient methods for conducting reproducible, computational, and data-intensive research. Our mission is to enhance research efficiency through compute, data management, community engagement, and consultancy support. We aim to develop an institute-wide capability that enables data to be safely integrated, shared, and published, in compliance with grant, publication, and regulatory standards.</p><p>Our primary hardware resource is an on-premise HPC called <span class="fontColorBlue"><strong>Milton</strong></span>, specifically designed to cater to the complex needs of researchers and their laboratories.&nbsp;<span class="fontColorBlue"><strong>Milton</strong></span> is a high-powered computing system capable of handling the intricate tasks and large-sized files that conventional computers struggle with. Built with research in mind, it also adheres to policies and procedures that ensure compliance with legal requirements related to research data.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemePrimary">Compute Resources&nbsp;</span></h3><p>One of the main components of <span class="fontColorBlue"><strong>Milton</strong></span> is a&nbsp;<strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Batch-jobs.aspx" href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Batch-jobs.aspx">SLURM</a></strong>&nbsp;batch system and there are several options for interactive work as well.&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Milton-hardware.aspx" href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Milton-hardware.aspx"><strong><u>Milton hardware configuration page</u></strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/SLURM-partitions.aspx" href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/SLURM-partitions.aspx"><u><strong>SLURM partitions</strong></u></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;page&nbsp;will take you through the available resources, limitations and uses.&nbsp;We have an extensive library of scientific software and will help you get access to any other software that you need&nbsp;through the&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/modules.aspx" href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/modules.aspx"><strong><u>modules system</u></strong></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Starting.aspx" href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Starting.aspx"><strong>This overview</strong></a> will get you started with the documentation.&nbsp;We have a <span class="fontColorBlue"><strong>Milton User Group (MUG) </strong></span>mailing&nbsp;list, our main communication channel with all Milton users. <strong><a title="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/mug%40wehi.edu.au/groupsubscription.ashx?action=join&amp;source=SharePoint&amp;guid=4bd04065-babd-4a0f-97ea-6ddd2b7a23e6" data-interception="off" data-cke-saved-href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/mug%40wehi.edu.au/groupsubscription.ashx?action=join&amp;source=SharePoint&amp;guid=4bd04065-babd-4a0f-97ea-6ddd2b7a23e6" href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/mug%40wehi.edu.au/groupsubscription.ashx?action=join&amp;source=SharePoint&amp;guid=4bd04065-babd-4a0f-97ea-6ddd2b7a23e6">Subscribe</a></strong> and follow it&nbsp;so that&nbsp;you are kept up-to-date with&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/RCPNewsletter" href="/sites/RCPNewsletter"><u><strong>our monthly newsletter</strong></u></a>, the latest research computing news, and important system events.&nbsp;We also have&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Milton-dashboards.aspx" href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Milton-dashboards.aspx"><u><strong>dashboards</strong></u></a>&nbsp;to monitor resource utilisation. They are accessible from&nbsp;<em>within</em>&nbsp;<em>WEHI’s network only</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>As collaborations, digital data, computational methods, and research outputs continue to expand, computing becomes increasingly essential. As data grows, so does the effort required to manage, explore, analyze, and share it. Research Computing provides platforms and expertise to help researchers scale their work beyond the desktop. Our RC teams can also help researchers access public clouds (such as AWS, Azure, or Google), tier 1 facilities (e.g., Pawsey, NCI), or facilities at other institutes (eg. <a title="https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/" data-interception="off" data-cke-saved-href="https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/" href="https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/">Spartan</a>).</p><p>We understand that embarking on a new project or technology can be intimidating, and our team is here to help you design and implement your workloads. If you're starting a new project and unsure about the most suitable compute options, don't hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" data-cke-saved-href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au">research.computing@wehi.edu.au</a>.
