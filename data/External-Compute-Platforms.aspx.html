<p>When starting a research project, you may find that you need computational resources greater than what WEHI can offer. For example, you may need more powerful or more GPUs, or your application is a traditional HPC application which requires fast interconnect. Or, you may simply need compute resources that you have administrative priviledges.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There's ample public compute resources besides Milton available for WEHI researchers, whether it is paid or even for free. This page documents the ones that we are aware of that you may find useful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note that all cloud services listed here, including Nectar Virtual Desktops, allow for administrator privileges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any other suggestions that might be useful to your WEHI colleagues, email them to research.computing@wehi.edu.au!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">No Financial Cost Resources</span></h3><figure class="table canvasRteResponsiveTable tableLeftAlign" style="width:100%;" title="Table"><table class="ck-table-resized bandedRowTableStyleTheme"><colgroup><col style="width:11.51%;"><col style="width:13.72%;"><col style="width:16.86%;"><col style="width:22.84%;"><col style="width:35.07%;"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>Resource</td><td>Institute/Organisation</td><td>Resource type</td><td>Limitations</td><td>Steps to get access</td></tr><tr><td>Nectar Research Cloud</td><td>Australian Research and Data Commons</td><td>Virtual Machines (including NVIDIA GPUs), database service, object store, VM orchestration</td><td>Usable resources are finite - as determined by grant application.</td><td>A trial project is available for 6 months, providing modest resources.
