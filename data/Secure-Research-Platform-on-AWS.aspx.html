<h2><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Introduction</span></h2><p><span><span><span><span>CFHAC has recently partnered with DiUS to implement a cloud-based computational platform for data analysis. </span>The primary aim of the project is to set up the platform for the Centre’s proteomics analysis of the ASPREE</span><span>&nbsp;(ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly, <a data-cke-saved-href="https://aspree.org/aus/" href="https://aspree.org/aus/">https://aspree.org/aus/</a>) cohort to identify early markers of dementia. The secondary aim of this work is to explore the need for, and appropriateness of, cloud-based data analysis solutions in WEHI-wide projects and to make the platform more widely available. RCP and ITS Research Systems&nbsp;(RS) have supported the work throughout all</span> <span>project phases and informed the design of the solution to ensure more groups/labs can make use of the platform in the future.</span></span></span></p><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Background</span></h3><p><span><span><span><span>The Colonial Foundation Healthy Ageing Centre (CFHAC, <a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/colonial-foundation-healthy-ageing-centre" href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/colonial-foundation-healthy-ageing-centre">https://www.wehi.edu.au/colonial-foundation-healthy-ageing-centre</a>) is a joint Centre between WEHI and the Royal Melbourne Hospital and was established in 2019 to identify early biomarkers for dementia. The team at CFHAC uses mass-spectrometry-based proteomics technology to study the protein composition of human samples. In ongoing work they are analysing tens of thousands of samples of the ASPREE cohort and are generating over 70-80 terabytes of data. For data analysis the team needs to merge de-identified clinical metadata, that have been collected and are stored by the ASPREE team at Monash University, with their proteomics data. This brings a set of requirements for the computational platform to meet compliance and security levels and to upscale and accelerate the large dataset analysis.</span></span></span></span></p><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">How the project unfolded</span></h3><p><span><span>The team used an agile approach along with new tools and techniques (see [Agile Ways of Working]), and provided&nbsp;fortnightly [Showcases] that were&nbsp;open for all WEHI. In the first phase of the project DiUS explored the needs of CFHAC and WEHI stakeholders to inform the solution design and to identify AWS Service Workbench as the most appropriate platform for their work. As part of the [Design Sprint] a comprehensive [Solution Design Document] was generated that compared common secure cloud platforms including AWS Service Workbench, Alan Turing's Data Safe Haven, Tailored Secure Sagemaker Solution and AWS DataZone. In the following phases DiUS implemented AWS Service Workbench and onboarded WEHI team members.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The team also partnered with RedBear IT for an independent [Compliance and Security Assessment] of the platform. RedBear IT was onboarded early in the project to inform on the solution design from a security perspective and to enable the team to address emerging issues during the platform built. RedBear IT performed an&nbsp;AWS Well Architected Framework (WAF) review,&nbsp;a CIS (Centre for Internet Security) AWS Security assessment&nbsp;against the AWS service implementation as well as a&nbsp;penetration testing against the Service Workbench solution as implemented by the team. They further assessed compliance standards (project relevant privacy laws and data sharing agreement) against implemented controls in the overall solution. </span></span>Based on these reports, the team has undergone remedial measures and outcomes from a re-testing by RedBear IT will be made available shortly as well.</p><h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Project Documentation and Training Material</span></h3><p><span><span>CFHAC, DiUS, RCP and ITS worked collaboratively in this project to transfer and disseminate knowledge at WEHI for use, maintenance and onboarding of new projects into the AWS Service Workbench. As part of this process a&nbsp;[Detailed Design Document] was developed; the document is organised in three sections, the first section outlines the design decisions and deployment structure, the second section provides instructions for the platform admin and the third section gives user instructions for the end users of the platform. It further includes links to more detailed reading on user guides and FAQ, Service Workbench deployment, Rstudio configuration, and dataset onboarding</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;and a security remediation report (work in progress).</span></span>​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p>
