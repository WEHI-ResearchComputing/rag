<h2><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Introducing RCP</span></h2><p>We are a group of software engineers with broad experience in different research fields and computational sciences. We aim to support WEHI's strategic plans by investing in and building new computational research and data analytics capabilities.&nbsp;We collaborate with researchers to help them run their computational research on WEHI infrastructure or, where appropriate, on external resources such as commercial and research clouds and local and national facilities.&nbsp;The Research Computing Platform is part of WEHI's <a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/About-RC.aspx">Research Computing</a> which also includes the ITS Research Systems team, and we are in the&nbsp;<a href="/sites/institute/SitePages/Computational-Biology-Theme.aspx">Computational Biology Theme</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Our Vision</span></h3><p>A computational research environment with world-class support and expertise that enables WEHI researchers with new capabilities and opportunities</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Our Mission</span></h3><p>Is to create a collaborative, multi-disciplinary platform that supports and advocates for WEHI researchers and their computational research.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Our Support</span></h3>
<blockquote><p>​​​​​​​We are research software engineers, passionate about finding optimised, reproducible, efficient solutions to your computational problems.</p></blockquote>
