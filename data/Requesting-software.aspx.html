<h2>Requesting new software</h2><p>The nature of research is such that new software is continually being written to support new instruments and new analyses.</p><p>The software you need may already be available, so check our <a data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/modules.aspx" href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/modules.aspx" title="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/modules.aspx" data-interception="on">modules guide</a> to determine if the software is available in the module system. Many software packages can be easily installed by users, see our guide for <a href="/sites/rc2/SitePages/Installing-software.aspx" data-cke-saved-href="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Installing-software.aspx" data-interception="on" title="https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/sites/rc2/SitePages/Installing-software.aspx">installing software</a> that follows common conventions.<br></p><p>If the software is not available or you are having difficulty installing it, or are just seeking advice please submit a request to <a data-cke-saved-href="mailto:support@wehi.edu.au" href="mailto:support@wehi.edu.au" target="_blank" title="mailto:support@wehi.edu.au" data-interception="off">support@wehi.edu.au</a>. Please provide:<br><br></p><ul><li>a link to the software</li><li>where you need it installed</li><li>any problems you have encountered</li><li>indicate if the software will definitely be used by a number of people in the long term.</li></ul><p>If it is beyond the scope of what users can be expected to install and maintain, Research Computing (RC) will install it. If it is not, RC will help you to install it yourself in your home area.</p>
