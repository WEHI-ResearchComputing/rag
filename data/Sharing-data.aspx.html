<h2>Sharing data with collaborators (or yourself)</h2><p>Currently, WEHI does not have self-serve support to share data with collaborators or "pull" data out of WEHI for use elsewhere. This document describes, in broad terms, what current options might look like.</p><p>Please contact <a data-cke-saved-href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" href="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" target="_blank" title="mailto:research.computing@wehi.edu.au" data-interception="off">Research Computing</a> directly or via <a data-cke-saved-href="mailto:support@wehi.edu.au" href="mailto:support@wehi.edu.au" target="_blank" title="mailto:support@wehi.edu.au" data-interception="off">support@wehi.edu.au</a> to discuss your requirements. This document does not discuss publishing data.</p><p><span class="fontColorRed"><strong>Please Note:</strong></span><br><em>You need to ensure that you are entitled to share your data with collaborators or move it to other sites.

<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Transferring your own data to or from other facilities</span></h3><p>If you need to "pull" your data onto another facility, e.g. Spartan, Pawsey, NCI, etc, ITS can provision an sftp (secure file transfer protocol) service for you.</p><p>To access your data, you need to log in to the sftp service with your WEHI login and password. For this reason, this mechanism is not suitable for sharing data with collaborators, unless you also have a login at your partner's institution. Sharing your credentials with other parties is a serious breach of the WEHI ITS acceptable use policy.</p><p>If you have data on another facility you can probably pull it from there to WEHI using scp. If, for whatever reason, that does not work ITS can provision an sftp service that you can write your data to.</p>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Sharing data with collaborators</span></h3><p>There are a number of possibilities for sharing data.</p><ol><li>It may be that a partner has an option to push the data directly but possibly won't.</li><li><a data-interception="off" title="https://www.aarnet.edu.au/network-and-services/cloud-services-applications/cloudstor" href="https://www.aarnet.edu.au/network-and-services/cloud-services-applications/cloudstor" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.aarnet.edu.au/network-and-services/cloud-services-applications/cloudstor">CloudStor</a> is available to anyone with an Australian Access Federation login, which includes Melbourne University. Researchers can share up to 1TB of data.</li><li>Via a cloud service such as AWS. This involves one partner provisioning cloud storage and providing the partner with access credentials. For large data transfers, this can be expensive, try to get your partner to pay for it. Contact Research Computing and we can estimate the costs and, if necessary, set up the storage, access credentials, and help transfer data.</li><li>Small amounts of data can be shared through One Drive (using your WEHI account) or Melbourne Uni <a href="https://gateway.research.unimelb.edu.au/resources/platforms-infrastructure-and-equipment/research-infrastructure-platforms/research-computing-services/services/data-storage-management/figshare" data-cke-saved-href="https://gateway.research.unimelb.edu.au/resources/platforms-infrastructure-and-equipment/research-infrastructure-platforms/research-computing-services/services/data-storage-management/figshare" target="_blank" data-interception="off" title="https://gateway.research.unimelb.edu.au/resources/platforms-infrastructure-and-equipment/research-infrastructure-platforms/research-computing-services/services/data-storage-management/figshare">Fig Share</a>.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</li></ol>
<h3><span class="fontColorThemeSecondary">Sharing large amounts of data externally</span></h3><p>As mentioned in #2 of the sharing data section (above), the best way at present to share large amounts of data externally is to use Cloudstor at UniMelb.</p><p>Every WEHI researcher can sign up for an AAF affiliated email address/login if you don't already have one and Cloudstor can take up to 1TB of data. It is also possible to script, if you wish.</p><p>In the future, the Research Data Management team is looking to implement a WEHI-sponsored solution, but this is unlikely to be implemented until some time in 2021 at the earliest.</p><h4><span class="fontColorBlue">Using Cloudstor - instructions</span></h4><p><span class="fontColorBlue"></span><span class="fontColorRed">AARNET, who currently host Cloudstor, have announced the service will be decommissioned on Friday 15 December 2023, therefore, we recommend its use for short term projects ONLY.

This descibes the browser-based interface which is adequate for small datasets. For large datasets, especially datasets on WEHI central storage the web interface is not usable. The main reason is that the data has to be pulled from storage over the network to your local machine before being uploaded by the browser. This is particularly cumbersome if you are working remotely via a domestic, hotel or airport network.
